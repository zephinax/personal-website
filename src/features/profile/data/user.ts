  about: `
  I'm Amirali, a developer with experience in both hardware and software engineering.
  I specialize in building full-stack web applications using **Next.js, React, Express, and MongoDB**, with a strong focus on **Dockerized deployments** using **Docker Compose**.

  I enjoy designing scalable architectures, optimizing performance, and mentoring developers in clean, maintainable code practices.
  My workflow often bridges embedded systems and web technologies — from low-level firmware to high-level cloud deployments.

  also a **mechatronics student**, continuously strengthening my mathematical foundation while balancing work and study.

  > **Zephinax** represents the endless pursuit of innovation in the world of technology.
