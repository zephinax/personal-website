I'm thrilled that two of my projects were recently featured by [OrcDev](https://www.youtube.com/@orcdev) on his YouTube channel in videos about [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) tools!

My Portfolio Website ([chanhdai.com](https://chanhdai.com)) was highlighted in "**Top 10 Shadcn Tools You Need Right Now!**" — OrcDev described it as one of the best open-source developer portfolios, built with Next.js and shadcn/ui.

[React Wheel Picker](https://react-wheel-picker.chanhdai.com) appeared in "**10 Tools to Make Your Shadcn Apps Beautiful**" — It's an iOS-like wheel picker for React with smooth inertia scrolling and infinite loop support, proudly backed by the [▲Vercel OSS Program](https://vercel.com/blog/summer-2025-oss-program#react-wheel-picker).

Big thanks to [OrcDev](https://x.com/theorcdev) for featuring both projects. If you're building with shadcn, I'd love for you to check them out and see how they can fit into your apps!
